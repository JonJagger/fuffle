fuffle  (Fast Unbiased Feedback)
================================
Go to http://fuffle.meteor.com
Type in your question and hit enter.
Your URL will now be something like this http://fuffle.meteor.com/answer/2e34f1
Everyone who wants to give an answer goes to this URL.
Each person types in their answer and hits enter.
Each person then sees everyone's answers.
If any of the answers are numeric min,max,std.dev will be shown too.

Seeing everyone's answers only *after* answering yourself
helps to avoid initial bias (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring).

If you don't type in an answer you can still hit enter.
You'll still see everyone else's answers. This should be useful
if you want to display the answers without providing an answer.
Eg if you are faciliating or presenting.
