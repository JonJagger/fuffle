fuffle  (Fast Unbiased Feedback)
================================
A simple Meteor app deployed at fuffle.meteor.com

Go to http://fuffle.meteor.com
Type in your question and click the button.
Your URL will now be something like this http://fuffle.meteor.com/2e34f1
Everyone who wants to give an answer goes to this URL.
Each person types in their answer and clicks the button.
Each person then sees everyone's answers.

Seeing everyone's answers only <em>after</em> answering yourself
helps to avoid initial bias (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring">Anchoring</a>).

If you don't type in an answer you can still click the button.
You'll still see everyone else's answers. This should be useful
if you want to display the answers without providing an answer.
Eg if you are faciliating or presenting.
